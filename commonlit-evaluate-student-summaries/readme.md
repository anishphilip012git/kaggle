Learnings:
Major learning: Worked on text-based data to identify and create suitable data features to create a valid model to evaluate essays written by students
Problem Type: regression

Key python learning: NLTK kit for natural language processing
Some interesting learnings and features:
1. Identifying bad words in a text
2. Identifying tokens using nltk
3. Identifying stop words in a text 
4. Identifying spell and grammar corrections (grammar correction count) in a text. Needed to install Java on python notebook in runtime for this.
5. Measuring text similarity based on cosine similarity of text
6. Measured Automated Readability Index of a text

Also identified some interesting outliers in the dataset.
Developed a baseline model 
Applied 
  1. Linear regression
  2. Random Forest
  ~I tried Support vector machines as well
  3. Ensemble method: Gradient Boost Regression Method

Best model : Gradient Boost Regression Method
